Wow, It's year #4 of the Greenhouse Giveaway! It is with immense pleasure to nurture all of these lovelies, and to know that so many will be shared across our community. All seeds are organic from our very own Sow True Seeds. For details on the plant and how to grow it, please click on the link.

Meanwhile, we have enough increased traffic (yay!) that we upgraded the ordering process.

- Confirmation is immediate.
- Confirmation will include what you ordered.
- Confirmation will note anything that became unavailable if somebody ordered while you were shopping.
- You cannot place an order without providing an email address, guaranteeing that I know who ordered the plants!
- I've now sorted the plants between vegetables, flowers, herbs, and berry cuttings for an easier shopping experience.

All plants will continue to grow in the greenhouse throughout April. Pick-up is intended to be during the Plant Garden Party on Saturday, April 26. [Please RSVP to help me plan well.](https://forms.gle/H6jtnGi65vmbAWkF9)
